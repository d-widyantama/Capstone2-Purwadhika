# Exploratory Data Analysis of NYC Taxi Operations from TLC Data 
## [Capstone 2 JCDS Purwadhika]

**Preface**

This project is created as an exercise and to complete my Capstone Module 2 Project of Data Science bootcamp in Purwadhika,
and also serves as a preview of my work and marks my learning journey of becoming a full fledged Data Scientist.

## Before you dive in
This project comprises of several part in different format:
1. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/d-widyantama/Capstone2-Purwadhika/blob/main/V1-EDA-NYCTaxi.ipynb) for more detailed Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. [Tableau Story]() for Data Visualization and Analysis
3. [Tableau Dashboard]()
4. [Slides Format]()


## About The Project
---

# **Overview**
New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the agency responsible
for licensing and regulating New York City's medallion (yellow) taxis, street hail livery (green) taxis,
for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) regulates how much a cab can charge per mile or per minute, determines a cab company's leasing fees for drivers, monitors routes taken by the drivers (to ensure they are not artificially inflating the price), and much more. In essence, a cab company (or a cab driver) can only make as much money as the government allows them to make.

The taxis in New York are operating in NYC area which divided by 5 borough:
1. 'Manhattan'
2. 'Brooklyn'
3. 'Queens', 
4. 'Bronx',
5. 'Staten Island']

**For non New Yorkers:**
Boroughs (pronounced burrow) are formal subdivisions of cities that have some aspects of self-government.

The TLC collects trip record
information for each taxi and for-hire vehicle trip completed by our licensed drivers and vehicles.
We receive taxi trip data from the technology service providers (TSPs) that provide electronic
metering in each cab, **this data will be the base of our dataset** in our analysis.



## **Stakeholder Statement**

Taxi companies may be interested in understanding demand patterns, identifying popular pickup/drop-off locations, and pricing strategies to maximize revenue. They may also want to improve service quality and efficiency based on customer behavior analysis.

## **Goals Setting & Problem Statement**

This project analysis generally aims to provide insights on the day-to-day operations of NYC taxi, 
    
    1. How to optimize revenues and streamlining operations?  
   
    2. How to to better serve customers by undertanding their behaviours?  
   
    3. How to optimize the distribution of drivers?
